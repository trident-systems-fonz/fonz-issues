# Fisheries of New Zealand - Issues

## What's this for?

This is a public repository for recording issues associated with 
the [Fisheries of New Zealand](http://fonz.tridentsystems.co.nz) website.
The list of current issues can be viewed [here](https://github.com/trident-systems-fonz/fonz-issues/issues).
Most users will not need to use this list and will instead simply submit issues via the 'comment' 
button of the FONZ website.

## Why is it here?

This repository is currently owned by the ['machine user'](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys), 
[trident-systems-fonz](https://github.com/trident-systems-fonz).
Ideally, it would be owned by the organisation [Trident Systems](https://github.com/trident-systems) which 
owns the FONZ website.
Unfortunately, at the time of writing, [Github does not allow organisation accounts to create OAuth tokens](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14149514/how-to-create-oauth2-token-for-github-enterprise-under-organization).
We need an OAuth token so that the FONZ website can post new issues to this repository without leaking 
any account secrets. Hence, this repository has to be owned by a Github user, not a Github organisation.
